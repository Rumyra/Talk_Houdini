# CSS Houdini: The magic of CSS and JavaScript

A talk about CSS Houdini

## About

How do you make a website? Me? I follow second star to the right and straight on til morning. Using everything I have learnt of course. But sometimes more fairy dust is necessary.

Enter a whole suite of API's that will help navigate these skies. The speaker with talk you through what they are, where you can find them and of course how to use them. This is a time of stranger things, this is CSS Houdini.

## Slides

I don't upload my slides due to some problems I've had with copyright infringement (As in people taking my slides ðŸ˜¢).

However, you can find all the slides within the talk in the [index file](https://github.com/Rumyra/Talk_Houdini/blob/master/index.html) within this build. It's just an HTML file so pretty easy to navigate - all my slide notes are there as well, within the markup.

For each conference I tag a version, so just check the tags for your conference (no two talks are the same).


## Get in touch

I tend to talk about Creative Coding, Audio and new web technologies. I either do this stand-a-lone or as part of the [{ Live : JS } collective](http://livejs.network/), where we also provide workshops, installations and shows.

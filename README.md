## Slides

I don't upload my slides due to some problems I've had with copyright infringement (As in people taking my slides ðŸ˜¢).

However, you can find all the slides within the talk in the [index file](https://github.com/Rumyra/Talk-Web-Audio/blob/master/views/index.html) within this build. It's just an HTML file so pretty easy to navigate - all my slide notes are there as well, within the markup.

For each conference I tag a version, so just check the tags for your conference (no two talks are the same).
